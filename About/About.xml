        Adds higher tiers of power generation buildings. They require research and cost more to build, but will save
        space in your colony by generating more power per square foot.

        Generally, the mk2 version of each generator costs 4x as much as the regular one, and generates 2x as much power.
        I also gave them twice the hitpoints and work to build.
